# Introduction

## What is a database?

A Database or DB it's all the information we can store somewhere, not only in computers, literally in anywhere, in a paper, a todo list, a receipt, anywhere.

But if we use this concept on something where we can store forever without looses, we can see that is something extremely useful.

That is a Database(DB), and with its usefulness, we can see DBs everywhere.

Examples:
- Online stores(Amazon, Ebay);
- Search engines(Google, Bing);
- Social media (Instagram, Twitter);
- Contacts list of your phone;
- And million of other things;
