# Constraints

```
NOT NULL
```
If you use not null Constraint, makes a require to have a name in there, in the specific row you used it.

```
UNIQUE
```
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns. A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.

```
DEFAULT 
```
If we set the default constraint, when we create the table within a value in some rows, default the values is setted as we pass the parameter.

```
AUTO_INCREMENT
```
When we use the auto increment constraint, when we create a table without setting the key data, example: a primary key in the row, we have the auto incremented value in there. 1, 2,3, 4, 5 and etc...
