# Update & Delete

## Update

```
UPDATE
```
Using update we can select the table to update or change the data you want.

```
SET
```
Set will specify the column you want to update.

```
WHERE
```
You can use a condition to update the rows that you want. Example: 
```
WHERE key = '2';
```

## Delete

And to delete, we can use basically the  same logic when we updating.
```
DELETE
```
Example
```
DELETE FROM student
WHERE student_id = 5;
```
